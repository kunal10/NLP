Instructions:

1) Compilation:

   cd path_to_LangauageModelling_folder
   javac -d bin src/nlp/lm/*.java

    This will generate .class files in LanguageModelling/bin

2) Execution:

    cd path_to_LangauageModelling_folder
    
    // To run Backward Bigram Model    
    java -cp bin nlp.lm.BigramModel data/brown/ 0.1
    
    // NOTE : We are currently instantiating model type to backward in the 
    // main method of BigramModel.java To test for forward model change it to
    // FORWARD, recompile and execute.
    
    // To run Bidirectional Bigram Model
    java -cp bin nlp.lm.BidirectionalBigramModel data/brown/ 0.1

    This will run BidirectionalBigram Model on brown data set using 90% data for
    training and 10% for testing.
             
Main Classes:

1) BigramModel : Can be instantiated in FORWARD or BACKWARD mode to get 
   appropriate model.  

2) Bidirectional Bigram Model : Contains 2 Bigram Models (one for each mode) and
   combines their result to yield a better result.
   
All the models can be tested in 3 modes :  ALL, SHORT, LONG representing the 
sentences that are to be included in the testing set. We have used a sentence
length threshold of 5 for classifying a sentence as short or long.

NOTE : Currently both the models are hardcoded to test in ALL mode.

TODOs : 

- Add a flag for FORWARD, BACKWARD model instantiation in BigramModel.java so 
  that this can be specified from command line.
- Add a flag for test mode.
- Add a train mode and a corresponding flag for it.
- Add a flag for sentence length threshold.
